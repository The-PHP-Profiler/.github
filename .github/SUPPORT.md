# Support

Need help? We have several ways to reach us, depending on your preferences and needs.

## Documentation

If you haven't already, read our [documentation](https://the-firehub-project.github.io/core/).
These docs have common use cases, and might be helpful to browse before
submitting an issue.
You can contribute to our documentation by creating PRs against the
[the-firehub-project.github.io](https://github.com/The-FireHub-Project/the-firehub-project.github.io) repository.

## Github

For issues with code (and especially if you need to share debug output)
we recommend Github issues boards.

- [FireHub Issues](https://github.com/The-FireHub-Project/FireHub/issues): is
  recommended for most issues with the FireHub Framework.
- [Documentor Issues](https://github.com/The-FireHub-Project/Documentor/issues): is
  recommended for most issues with phpDocumentor template for FireHub.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/The-FireHub-Project/discussions)
  questions, feedback, and suggestions should go here. Feel free to
  create new discussion there.

### How do I ask for help?

After you identify a bug, you should search the respective issue board
for similar problems reported by other users. Another user may be facing
the same issue, and you can add a +1 (in message or icon) to indicate to
the maintainers that the issue is pressing for you as well. The squeaky
wheel gets the grease!

### How is time allocated to addressing issues?

While we wish we could address every issue, there are only so many hours
in the day. We rank issues based on the following questions:

1. How many users are affected?
1. Is there a proposed work-around?
1. In how many instances does the proposed work-around fail?

With these simple questions, we can ensure that work is directed and has
the maximum impact! However, if your issue doesn't seem to be getting
attention you can still move it along using some of the strategies
discussed below.

### What if my issue goes stale?

Issues can go stale for a number of reasons. In the bullets below, we
will review some of these reasons, along with strategies for managing
them:

1. *The issue needs a gentle reminder*. Try targeting a few people with
   a "`ping @username any thoughts about this?`" in the case that it
   was forgotten.
1. *Was your issue properly explained*? You are much more likely to get
   help when you give clear instructions for reproducing the issue, and
   show effort on your part to think about what the problem might be.
   If possible, try to come up with a way to reproduce the issue that
   does not involve a special environment or exotic hardware.
1. *Is there broad need*? It could be that your issue isn't having a big
   enough impact for other users to warrant the time for the small
   development team. In this case, you might try implementing a
   suggested fix, and then asking for help with the details.
1. *Is your issue scattered?* When many issues pile up on boards, it
   sometimes is the case that issues are duplicated. It's important to
   find these duplicates and merge them into one, because in finding
   the duplicate you find another user to talk to about the issue.
1. *Does your issue need to have scope?* The idea of scoping an issue
   means framing it with respect to other components of the software.
   For example, if you have a feature request to see metadata about an
   object, you might frame that in the context of container
   introspection, and suggest an addition to the software that fits
   with the "inspect" command. A very powerful thing to do would be to
   open up an issue that (not only discusses your specific addition)
   but also opens up discussion to the general community for "How we
   can do introspection" better. Then create a set of issues and add
   them to a [Github
   milestone](https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/).
   This kind of contribution is much more powerful than simply asking
   for something.
